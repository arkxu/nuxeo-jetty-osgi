Attempt to make nuxeo ecm (http://www.nuxeo.com) work with jetty OSGi.
- jetty-osgi-7.0.1.012 for equinox supports an "endorsedlibs" folder where we can place jar files that equinox will search as if they were an endorsed library.
- our primary target consists of supporting the user management of nuxeo inside jetty-osgi running inside eclipse equinox.
- nuxeo sources are taken from the latest 5.3 version of the mercurial repository.

Status:
There are a number of split-packages issues.
For example in org.nuxeo.ecm.platform, org.nuxeo.ecm.platform.UserService accesses protected fields of org.nuxeo.ecm.platform.usermanager.UserManagerDescriptor. The UserManagerDescriptor is in a different plugin and it fails to execute with the exception:
java.lang.IllegalAccessError: tried to access field org.nuxeo.ecm.platform.usermanager.UserManagerDescriptor.groupMembersField from class org.nuxeo.ecm.platform.usermanager.UserService
	at org.nuxeo.ecm.platform.usermanager.UserService.recomputeUserManager(UserService.java:77)
	at org.nuxeo.ecm.platform.usermanager.UserService.getUserManager(UserService.java:48)
	at osgitest.Activator.start(Activator.java:42)

Making the fields of that object public solves the issue.
Using the protected setters solve the issue.
Making this bundle a fragment of the api bundle would solve the issue but prevent access to UserService from other bundles.

We will keep track of each change we did to nuxeo sources here and contact the nuxeo team when we have been far enough to make this an interesting contribution.
